# Example notebooks for running analysis code
The `example_fileIO.ipynb` notebook introduces basic file I/O using `uproot` and the coffea `NanoEvents` object. The `example_coffeaAnalyzer.ipynb` notebook shows how to run the iDMe coffea analyzer from a jupyter notebook (not recommended for large samples, since it will take forever!)

For a more detailed intro to `coffea`, check out the [tutorials](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/examples.html) on their website. I would recommend starting with the ones titled "Reading data with coffea NanoEvents", "Analysis tools and accumulators", and "Coffea Processors"
